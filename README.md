# The Idea
Ever found yourself at home wondering if you have what it takes to beceome a master bartender? We have, that is where we came up with the idea for Whiskey Business. 

A platform that allows users to either search for Cocktial Recipes by name or by random ingredients that they may already have in their home. 

# Getting Started 
Software application- Whiskey Business does not requre any software installation to operate. 

# User Guide
Using Whiskey Business is easy!

Once on the home page you can click the "Get Started" button and it will take you to where you can search by ingredient or by specific cocktail name.
